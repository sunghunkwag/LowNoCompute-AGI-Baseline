# LowNoCompute-AGI-Baseline
A minimal AGI baseline framework for meta-learning and policy orchestration under strict low-compute or no-compute constraints. Extends SSM-MetaRL-TestCompute: explores effective generalization with State Space Models, meta-RL, and test-time adaptation for resource-limited environments.
