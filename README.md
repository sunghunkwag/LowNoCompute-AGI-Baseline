# LowNoCompute-AGI-Baseline

A minimal, modular AGI baseline framework for meta-learning and policy orchestration under strict low-compute or no-compute constraints. Inspired by, and extending, the SSM-MetaRL-TestCompute repository: this project explores methods for effective generalization and adaptation with State Space Models, meta-RL, and automated test-time adaptationâ€”targeting the most resource-limited environments.
